Simple Creation-Answer Machine
=======================================

Introduction
----------------

In quiz shows, especially entertainment activities (e.g. competitive
answering activities), organizers often apply a buzzer system in order
to accurately, fairly and visually determine the seat number of a
responder.

Now the system can illustrate the accuracy and equity of the judgment by
data, which improves the entertainment. At the same time, it is more
fair and just. In this lesson, we will use some buttons, buzzers, and
LEDs to make a quiz buzzer system.

Experimental Principle
---------------------------

Button 1, 2 and 3 are answer buttons, and button 4 is the
reset button. If button 1 is pressed first, the buzzer will beep, the
corresponding LED will light up and all the other LEDs will go out. If
you want to start another round, press button 4 to reset.

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:**\ Build the circuit

**Step 2:** Open the code file.

**Step 3:** Select the Board and Port.

**Step 4:** Upload the sketch to the board.

Now, first press button 4 to start. If you press button 1 first, you
will see the corresponding LED light up and the buzzer will beep. Then
press button 4 again to reset before you press other buttons.

Code Analysis
---------------------

| The code for this experiment may be a bit long. But the syntax is
  simple. Let's see.
| **Workflow:** Read the state of button 4, if button 4 is pressed, the
  LED on pin 10 is illuminated while reading the state of the remaining
  buttons. If one of the buttons is detected to be pressed, the buzzer
  beeps and lights the corresponding LED until button 4 is pressed
  again.

**Code Analysis** **23-1** **loop() function**

.. code-block:: python

    b4State = digitalRead(button4);

    //when button4 pressed

    if(b4State == 0)

    {

      if(b4State == 0) //confirm that the button4 is pressed. One pin of the
      button is connected to pin 9, the other pin is connected to GND, and
      when the button is pressed, pin 9 is pulled low.

      {

        flag = 1; //if so,flag is 1

        digitalWrite(LED4, HIGH); //turn the host LED on

        delay(200);

      }

    }

    if(1 == flag)

    {

      //read the state of the state of buttons

      b1State = digitalRead(button1);

      b2State = digitalRead(button2);

      b3State = digitalRead(button3);

      //If the button1 press the first

      if(b1State == 0)

      {

        flag = 0;

        digitalWrite(LED4, LOW);

        Alarm(); //buzzer sound

        digitalWrite(LED1,HIGH); //turn the LED1 on only

        digitalWrite(LED2,LOW);

        digitalWrite(LED3,LOW);

        while(digitalRead(button4)); //detect the button4,if pressed,out of the
        while loop

      }

    }


**Code Analysis** **23-2** **Alarm() function**

.. code-block:: python

    void Alarm()

    {

      for(int i=0;i<100;i++){

        digitalWrite(buzzerPin,HIGH); //the buzzer sound

        delay(2);

        digitalWrite(buzzerPin,LOW); //without sound

        delay(2); //when delay time changed,the frequency changed

      }

    }

The alarm() function is to set the buzzer to beep.
